<!-- [DOXYGEN] -->

If you are stuck with a problem using QDMI or have questions, please get in touch at our
[Issues](https://github.com/Munich-Quantum-Software-Stack/QDMI/issues) or
[Discussions](https://github.com/Munich-Quantum-Software-Stack/QDMI/discussions). We'd love to help.

You can save time by following this procedure when reporting a problem:

- Do try to solve the problem on your own first.
- Search through past [Issues](https://github.com/Munich-Quantum-Software-Stack/QDMI/issues) and
  [Discussions](https://github.com/Munich-Quantum-Software-Stack/QDMI/discussions) to see if someone
  else already had the same problem.
- Before filing a bug report, try to create a minimal working example (MWE) that reproduces the
  problem. It is much easier to identify the cause for the problem if a handful of lines suffice to
  show that something is not working.

You can also always reach us at
[mqss@munich-quantum-valley.de](mailto:mqss@munich-quantum-valley.de).
